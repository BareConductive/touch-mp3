# Bare Conductive Touch MP3 Demo Code

Simple touch-to-MP3 code for the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/). Touch electrode 0, **TRACK000.MP3** plays from the micro SD card. Touch electrode 1, **TRACK001.MP3** plays from the micro SD card, and so on. This is the code that ships with the [Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/).

## Requirements
* You should make sure that you have followed our [Setting up Arduino with your Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board/) tutorial before using this (or any other) of our code examples


## Install

1. Close the Arduino IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/BareConductive/touch-mp3/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **Touch_MP3** folder and move it to **Arduino Sketchbook Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Arduino
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Arduino	
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Arduino
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Arduino


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Arduino IDE - you should now be able to open the sketch in the **File -> Sketchbook** menu.
